                <p className="mt-5">
                Getting a plan is incredibly easy. Just scroll up to the pricing table, select one of the web hosting packages, and click on the Add to Cart button.
                Once you&apos;re on the checkout page, choose a subscription period. Although monthly payments are an option, we suggest opting for longer plans as they provide more value for your money.
                Next, sign up or sign in to your Hostinger account and choose a payment method. Add your personal details and click the Submit Secure Payment button to complete the registration process.
                Once you finish the payment process, you will receive login credentials to access your account. From there, you can manage websites, domains, databases, email accounts, files, and more.
